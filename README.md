Treehouse Techdegree: Full Stack Javascript Project 2; Paginating and Filtering lists of students

This project involves taking a list of HTML Elements that include pictures, names, and email addresses of students and paginates the list dynamically with javascript.

I attempted to achieve an Exceeds Expectations grade on this project by also unobtrusively adding a search bar that allows a user to filter the list dynamically. The results themselves are also paginated.
